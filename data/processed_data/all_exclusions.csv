p120,passive,4.05,y,y,experimenter error,data is actually in principle fine in the sense that the experimental session itself was OK and the yoking process ultimately was correct too. yoked ID was originally incorrectly entered in the subject log which caused us to think that this child got the active data from a 5yo (wrong age group). However the age group was entered incorrectly initially in the subject log and the child actually did receive data from a child from the correct age group (4yo; p110). Continuing to exclude this participant due to the intial data entry confusion and to preserve the 1:1 mapping. The data from this child is however in principle fine.,1,exp1,n
